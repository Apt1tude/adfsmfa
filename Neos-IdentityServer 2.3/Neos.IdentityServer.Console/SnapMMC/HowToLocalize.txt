# Localizing MFA Web parts

For security reasons, and to avoid unsafe code execution. 
The translation of the resources must be done by recompiling the code of the adfsmfa solution with Visual Studio and signing the code with your own key.

Remember that this is an open-source project. 
If you think you have a better translation and that it can be shared with everyone. you must post a pull-request at https://github.com/neos-sdi/adfsmfa/pulls. 
If these proposals are integrated, they will be maintained in the future.

You can also offer translations for unsupported languages (French, English, Spanish (draft)), such as German, Italian, Russian, etc.

If you do not want or can not recompile the solution, we'll give you a simpler alternative that does not require software development skills.
We think that this is not the best solution, but it can allow you to precisely test the interface you want to offer. 
Later, you will need to be able to upgrade your translations or to propose them to the community in order to integrate your work into the project.

Editing resource-based translations is only available for the Web Interface part.
The console and PowerShell do not allow resource-based translation.

How to do ?

1- Retrieve the complete code of the solution (version 2.3 or more)
2- unpack the source code on your workstation (no development tool required).
3- Move to the directory ..\Manage_Resources
4- Execute: 0-import_resources.cmd
5- Execute: 1-edit_resources.cmd
6- Move to the directory .. \Manage_Resources\Sources
7- With a text editor of your choice (Notepad, TextPad, VS, but not MSWord) modify the libellations present in the different .resx files.
8- Execute: 2-Build_resources.cmd (ES or FR)
9- Get the .resources files corresponding to the .resx files you have modified
10- Copy the .resources files on the different ADFS servers in C:\Program Files\MFA\ResourceSet
11- Restart the ADFS services (net stop adfssrv and net start adfssrv)

12- Done!
